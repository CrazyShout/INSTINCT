CoAlign: Pose-Robust Collaborative 3D Object Detection via Agent-Object Pose Graph Optimization

### Complemented Annotations for DAIR-V2X-C
Originally DAIR-V2X only annotates 3D boxes within the range of camera's view in vehicle-side. We supplement the missing 3D box annotations to enable the 360 degree detection. With fully complemented vehicle-side labels, we regenerate the cooperative labels for users, which follow the original cooperative label format.
